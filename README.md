# Description

Multifaceted software designed to accomedate small venues with point of sale software and easy analytics

# Currently Implemented

Automatic UI Fitting: Elements on the "Menu.csv" file will automatically be fitted to the user interface, allowing for more flexibility for venders.

Item and sale persistency, becuase menu items are stored in a .csv file, they can be saved to the hard disk and used the next time the application is opened. The same remains true for item sales, the applicaiton will record sales made.
